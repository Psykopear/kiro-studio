# Kiro Studio

This aims to be some kind of DAW some day.

My main motivation is to continue researching and learning on how to build real-time audio software for music production
using the Rust programming language (see [hero-studio] & [kiro-synth] for previous initiatives).
Please don't expect a polished product for a long time, if it ever becomes something ;-P
I plan to start with something small that doesn't require a UI, for example just using a MIDI surface.
If it goes well I might consider building some kind of MPC device that can run in the Raspberry Pi with a Touch Screen.
Let's see where it goes.
